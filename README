It is about 2 responsive web pages made for a friend who is passionate about woodworking in any form! :)

#
To create these web pages I was inspired by several sites that deal with such things and I used webscraping using "robots.txt" to see where I have permission :)


import requests

source = requests.get('https://www.blacktailstudio.com/blog/a-table-with-good-jeans').text

soup = BeautifulSoup(source, 'lxml')

article = soup.find('article')

print(article.prettify())
# headline = article.h2.a.text
# print(headline)

# summary = article.find('div', class_='row sqs-row').p.text
# print(summary)
